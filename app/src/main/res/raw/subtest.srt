1
00:00:05,858 --> 00:00:51,091
<i>Have a look at the sonar.</i>

2
00:00:51,482 --> 00:00:52,905
<i>Let me know what you find.</i>

3
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:55,615
<i>So far, nothing new,
my friend.</i>

4
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:57,469
<i>It just keeps getting worse.</i>

5
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,285
D'Angelo, Marks, talk to me.

6
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:24,959
We've moved to the sonar room.

7
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,530
Just nine rescued so far.

8
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:31,629
It's a mess, man.
This is the worst I've ever seen.

9
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:33,997
Help!

10
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:35,996
Help!

11
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,998
Somebody help me!

12
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:40,159
Help!

13
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,034
Who's there?

14
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,366
I got one more survivor.

15
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,431
Heading back to the
rescue vehicle now.

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,255
D'Angelo,
what the hell was that?

17
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,049
I have no idea.

18
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:58,508
Listen...

19
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,952
<i>Jonas, that's something
outside the ship.</i>

20
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:12,325
<i>There's something out there.</i>

21
00:02:22,703 --> 00:02:24,203
You okay, pal?

22
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:29,925
Oh, my God.

23
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:32,122
Something's crushing the hull.

24
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,106
Get back to the
rescue vehicle, now.

25
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:35,795
We're right behind ya!

26
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:41,797
Slide him up.

27
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:44,664
Marks, D'Angelo, report.

28
00:02:44,993 --> 00:02:46,039
You almost here?

29
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,345
<i>Jonas, listen to me!
We're trapped!</i>

30
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,662
- What?
- They're back down the hatch.

31
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:52,210
I'm coming back!

32
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:56,320
The sub is starting to collapse!

33
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:57,612
- Marks!
<i>- Jonas!</i>

34
00:02:57,654 --> 00:02:59,580
We need you down here
before it's too late!

35
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:03,466
The sub's been breached!

36
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:04,826
<i>There's water everywhere!</i>

37
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:06,504
<i>Jonas, the room is flooding!</i>

38
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,012
<i>Marks, we gotta get
this hatch open!</i>

39
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:10,664
<i>Come on, Jonas!
Where are you?</i>

40
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:11,950
<i>It's not going to work!</i>

41
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,727
<i>Jonas, hurry, please!</i>

42
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:15,198
<i>We just need more time!</i>

43
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:16,495
<i>Don't leave us!</i>

44
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:19,258
<i>- Help me, Jonas!
- We're over here!</i>

45
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,317
<i>Jonas, please!</i>

46
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:24,427
<i>Where are you? Jonas!</i>

47
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:26,135
Argh!

48
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,461
You lost your mind?

49
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:37,360
Back off, Heller!
If we go back, everyone dies.

50
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:38,782
Everyone!

51
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,710
What have you done?

52
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,740
Are we living the dream here
or what?

53
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:31,166
Welcome to Mana One,
Mr. Morris.

54
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:33,530
Get that thing away from me.

55
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:34,855
What are you doing?

56
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:38,142
Come on, bring it in.
There we go.

57
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,534
Good to see you again,
Mr. Morris.

58
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:41,649
This way, please.

59
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,680
Hey, you always smell so nice.
What is that, sandalwood?

60
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:46,906
It's impressive so far, I'll say.

61
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:48,470
Oh, here they are.

62
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:51,479
You remember my daughter, Suyin,
our chief marine biologist.

63
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:52,622
Hi.

64
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,827
Sorry, what was that?

65
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:05,953
I didn't catch it.

66
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:10,381
She said she likes your hat.

67
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,413
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:16,888 --> 00:06:19,309
- Let's go.
- Why don't we go? Yeah.

69
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:24,282
Your granddaughter's a pistol.

70
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:26,207
Okay.

71
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,453
What have we here?

72
00:06:30,585 --> 00:06:32,014
This is um...

73
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,181
really...

74
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,517
ugly.

75
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,762
You know, I realize that we're
under construction and everything

76
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:41,114
but I really think that
a world-class research institute

77
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:44,011
deserves a world-class entrance.

78
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:46,516
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

79
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,122
<i>O Level.</i>

80
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:53,428
Oh, wow.

81
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:55,437
Welcome to the O level.

82
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:58,208
Nice.

83
00:06:58,282 --> 00:07:00,038
This is our central hub

84
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:03,326
from which researchers
will access all five labs

85
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:04,693
once it's finished.

86
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,790
Wow.

87
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,427
Oh, look at that.

88
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:16,075
That's not something
you see every day.

89
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,131
Did you have those
whales here on Que?

90
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:26,332
I might have lured them
with some whale songs.

91
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:31,115
This is Ruthie
and her daughter Gracie.

92
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:34,135
Incredible.

93
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:37,681
Wow.

94
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,186
- Here we are.
- Please.

95
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,427
Follow me quickly.

96
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:42,923
I hope we are on time.

97
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,747
Come on in.

98
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:48,471
Oh, man.

99
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:51,587
I'd like you to meet
our engineer and sub designer

100
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:52,903
- Jaxx.
- Hey, Doc.

101
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:54,444
- Hello.
- Hi.

102
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:57,879
Uh, Dr. Heller,
our medical officer.

103
00:07:57,943 --> 00:07:59,260
Nice to meet you.

104
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:00,720
You're like Bones, huh?

105
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:03,533
DJ here, pilots our
remote explorer.

106
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:04,795
How's it going?

107
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:06,296
You're my first billionaire.

108
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,431
And, of course, Mac,
our station chief.

109
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:10,744
Mr. Morris, just in time.

110
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:11,936
So I keep hearing.

111
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:13,121
Have that.

112
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:14,865
Just in time for what?

113
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,461
<i>Good morning, Mr. Morris.</i>

114
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,730
Lori Taylor, our mission pilot.

115
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:19,984
<i>Hi, Mr. Morris.</i>

116
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:21,612
Welcome on board.
It's good to have you.

117
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:22,667
<i>Hey.</i>

118
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:24,120
H-How's it going
down there?

119
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,946
Where'd you learn
how to pilot a sub?

120
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:27,925
<i>I spent ten years with a certain</i>

121
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,537
whale-saving
environmental group

122
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:31,571
that shall remain unnamed
for legal reasons.

123
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:34,332
Ask her if she ever
blew up a whaling ship

124
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:35,858
- with a homemade torpedo.
- Hey!

125
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:37,129
No.

126
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,032
That is a good hire.

127
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:42,805
11 in 2.

128
00:08:42,884 --> 00:08:46,146
Water temperature
is at 6 degrees.

129
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:48,576
Mac, we are through
the thermocline.

130
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:50,767
We are approaching
11,000 meters.

131
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:53,149
100 meters from the bottom.

132
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,084
<i>Maybe.</i>

133
00:08:55,562 --> 00:08:57,477
<i>Maybe from the bottom.</i>

134
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:58,685
Maybe?

135
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,132
What does he mean,
"maybe"?

136
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:02,119
Come on.
Look at this.

137
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:05,121
Since 1875,
we've all believed

138
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,955
the Marianas Trench was
the deepest place on earth.

139
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:10,656
I have a theory that
what we think is the bottom

140
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,434
might actually be a layer
of hydrogen sulfide.

141
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:16,834
Beneath that cloud, in the
freezing cold thermocline,

142
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:19,194
there could be
a completely new world.

143
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:22,166
The Origin is about to see
if my father's right.

144
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:24,050
If there's warm water below,

145
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,741
that means we're going to be
the first to see it.

146
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:28,321
And what if you're wrong?

147
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:32,145
Then you have wasted
$1.3 billion.

148
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:35,764
You're kidding?

149
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,602
He's kidding, right?

150
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,996
Copy that.

151
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:42,287
Wait, what?

152
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:44,345
Ten meters,
approaching boundary.

153
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,400
Hovering at five meters.

154
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,508
Full stop.

155
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:53,619
Final checks.

156
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,096
- Jaxx?
- Good to go.

157
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:56,441
- Doc?
- Crew are go.

158
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:58,460
- DJ?
- Sub and rover are go.

159
00:09:58,571 --> 00:10:01,120
Origin crew,
we are go for insertion.

160
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:03,032
Insertion.

161
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:05,724
Is everything sexual
with you guys?

162
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:07,371
Sex, food, power,

163
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,078
- and money!
- Money!

164
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:10,261
Blow it up now!

165
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:11,992
- Pkkkww!
- Pkkkww!

166
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,929
Dive Control,
we are a go for...

167
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:16,451
insertion.

168
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:31,370
We're in.

169
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,827
You guys, we're in.

170
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,490
<i>It's a cloud.</i>

171
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:35,631
<i>It is not the bottom.</i>

172
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:37,485
Lori, be careful.
We don't know the depth

173
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:38,700
<i>on the other side of this.</i>

174
00:10:38,747 --> 00:10:40,347
<i>The sea floor could
come right up on you.</i>

175
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:41,651
<i>Copy that, Mac.</i>

176
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:42,969
<i>We're ready.</i>

177
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:54,276
You guys, we are through!

178
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,914
<i>I have multiple small
sonar contacts.</i>

179
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,669
<i>There's light down here.</i>

180
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,814
<i>Congratulations!</i>

181
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:02,656
Deploying the lights.

182
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:23,904
Lights deployed.
I'm gonna come around.

183
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:39,646
Whoa.

184
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:40,908
Yeah.

185
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,266
Oh, my goodness.

186
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:03,907
- Wow.
- Whoa.

187
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:06,131
Mac, tell me
you're getting this.

188
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,738
We're getting all of it, Lori.

189
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,991
Got a lot of
smiling faces up here.

190
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,298
DJ, we got positive terrain
to launch the rover?

191
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,647
Copy.

192
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,211
Launch is all yours.

193
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,807
Okay.

194
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:26,489
Rover is...

195
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:29,179
free.

196
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:31,850
Copy.

197
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:39,591
<i>Water temperature:
0.3 degrees Celsius.</i>

198
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:50,037
How is this possible?

199
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,774
This ecosystem

200
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:55,211
is completely cut off
from the rest of the ocean

201
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:57,338
by the freezing cold
thermocline.

202
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,000
We should find
all sorts of species

203
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:01,864
completely unknown to science.

204
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:04,544
Sounds like a good investment.

205
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,330
Lori, I have a contact.

206
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:12,457
Bearing 080.

207
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:15,738
Oh, it's big.

208
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:17,404
Oh, it's huge.

209
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:19,470
And it's moving fast.

210
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:23,903
DJ, is the rover seeing this?

211
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:27,109
Negative.

212
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:29,285
I'm gonna try and bring
out some more lights.

213
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:37,199
<i>Rover 1 signal interrupted.</i>

214
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,359
Whoa!
I just lost telemetry.

215
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:41,106
What the hell?

216
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:45,196
Origin, recommend
an immediate

217
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:47,895
<i>right turn, 350.
This could be a landslide.</i>

218
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,930
<i>Last time I checked, landslides
don't make 90 degree turns.</i>

219
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:02,728
It's right on us!
It's right on us!

220
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,614
What the hell was that?

221
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,961
Lori, what's going on
down there?

222
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:13,463
- You guys...
- What?

223
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:14,677
Come look at this.

224
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,182
Whoa.

225
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,290
What could do that
to the rover?

226
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,226
I don't think
I wanna know.

227
00:14:23,753 --> 00:14:25,253
It's coming back.

228
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:29,590
Oh, my God.

229
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:31,647
<i>Let's get outta here!
Blow the tanks!</i>

230
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:33,312
<i>I'm trying!
It's not working!</i>

231
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:35,966
<i>- Ignition down!
- Oh, my God.</i>

232
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:38,563
<i>Oh, my God. DJ, Mac.
There's something down here!</i>

233
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:39,765
<i>Jonas was right!</i>

234
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,528
<i>Jonas was right!
Do you cop...</i>

235
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,463
Lori, come in.

236
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:48,553
Origin, can you hear me?

237
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,036
Origin. Please respond.

238
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:54,081
- Come on.
- Lori, come in.

239
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,030
Wall, can you hear me?

240
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,728
Toshi?

241
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:07,467
Gather round, people.

242
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:09,068
Options?

243
00:15:09,568 --> 00:15:10,588
Not great.

244
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:11,958
We know they're alive.

245
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:14,278
I've still got telemetry
on their vitals.

246
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:15,937
How long do they have?

247
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:17,320
Maybe 18 hours.

248
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:18,853
Ballast bows are jammed.

249
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,275
Which means
it can't rise by itself.

250
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,722
If we attempt to tow it,

251
00:15:21,747 --> 00:15:23,995
it's 50/50 that the
tanks will explode

252
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,190
and breach the capsule.

253
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,362
Can't we go hatch to hatch?

254
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:27,515
Not a chance.

255
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:29,721
The external camera's showing
severe hatch damage.

256
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,047
We have to try something.

257
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:32,143
They're six miles down

258
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,646
and no one has ever attempted
a rescue at that depth.

259
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:36,495
Well, that's not exactly true.

260
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:39,635
No. No way.

261
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:41,098
We can handle this.

262
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,972
Not at 11,000 meters,
you can't.

263
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:45,999
We've gone 5,000 meters,
8,000 meters.

264
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,147
At some point,
it just becomes a number.

265
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:50,206
Why don't you try this number:
three.

266
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:52,190
That's how many people
have actually attempted

267
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:54,077
a rescue below 10,000 meters.

268
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:55,763
And the number one.

269
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,601
That's how many are left alive
to talk about it.

270
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,507
One man. Jonas Taylor.

271
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:00,918
And look what happened
to that one man

272
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:02,380
the last time he went
to these depths.

273
00:16:02,404 --> 00:16:04,776
He saved 11 people,
including you, Heller.

274
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,815
- That's what happened.
- He left our friends to die!

275
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,150
Because he had
pressure-induced psychosis.

276
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:11,038
Come on, Heller,
that was your diagnosis.

277
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:13,188
Jonas said
something attacked them.

278
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:15,902
Something big enough
to take out a nuclear submarine.

279
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,156
- He's a drunk!
- You're not listening!

280
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,549
He's washed up on
a beach in Thailand.

281
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:20,177
- Did you hear what Lori said?
- I heard it.

282
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:21,522
- Were you there?
- That's enough.

283
00:16:24,296 --> 00:16:27,141
We all heard
Lori's last transmission.

284
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:28,599
We have to consider

285
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:30,957
that Origin may have
encountered something similar

286
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:32,747
to what Jonas Taylor described.

287
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,077
Something he was able
to escape from.

288
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,805
Pa, please.

289
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,849
Prep the helicopter.

290
00:16:40,113 --> 00:16:41,731
We must go to Thailand.

291
00:17:18,757 --> 00:17:20,953
Your boat.
She's killing me.

292
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:23,794
Number one:
engine slips out of the gear.

293
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:25,302
And there's some leak
in the hydraulics.

294
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:26,865
Hey, I'll take
a look at it tonight.

295
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,372
That's what you said last night
and the night before that!

296
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:30,695
And the night before that.

297
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:32,515
Hey, I'm workin' up to it.

298
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:33,792
You drink too much.

299
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,679
Hey, now,
you're only saying that

300
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:38,439
because I literally
have a beer in my hand.

301
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:40,552
You always have
beer your hand.

302
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:42,565
You know why?

303
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:44,704
Because I drink too much?

304
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:11,400
Now this is shaping up to be
an eventful Tuesday evening.

305
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:13,629
You know I like
to make an entrance.

306
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:15,355
Oh, make up the five years?

307
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:17,055
Just showin' up
is makin' an entrance.

308
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,246
What, you livin' above
a bar, really?

309
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,613
Thinkin' it was the only way
to get you to come visit.

310
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:26,621
Jonas, allow me introduce...

311
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,435
It's an honor to meet you,
Dr. Zhang.

312
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:30,942
I always had a tremendous
respect for your work.

313
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,849
You're too kind, Mr. Taylor.

314
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,776
No, I'm not.
You're a good man.

315
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:36,949
Hey, can I offer
either you two a beer?

316
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:38,840
'Cause I'm gonna have a beer.

317
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,374
It's not a social call, Jonas.

318
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:44,197
You mean you didn't
helicopter in just to say hi?

319
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:46,865
You wound me, Mac.

320
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,176
- We have a serious...
- Problem?

321
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:51,501
'Cause uh...

322
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:53,435
just like you know,

323
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,528
I don't dive anymore.

324
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,997
- Don't be responsible for people...
- Mr. Taylor.

325
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,977
Hey, I mean no offense,
Dr. Zhang.

326
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:02,478
I mean, if there was
two people on this planet

327
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:04,220
that could get me
back into the water,

328
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:05,447
it's probably you two.

329
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,132
But you can't.

330
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:09,309
You're gonna tell
me your problem,

331
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:10,634
and I'll say no.

332
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:12,076
You're gonna offer me money.

333
00:19:12,473 --> 00:19:13,905
I'll still say no.

334
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,308
You're gonna appeal
to my better nature.

335
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:17,840
And I'm gonna say no.

336
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,673
Because I don't have one.

337
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:22,991
So I say,
why don't we sit down.

338
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,941
We'll enjoy a couple of beers,

339
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,593
and then we can
get you on your way.

340
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,233
Jonas.

341
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,418
This happened this morning.

342
00:19:33,794 --> 00:19:35,703
<i>Let's get outta here!
Blow the tanks!</i>

343
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:37,161
<i>I'm trying!
It's not working!</i>

344
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:38,893
<i>I need help!</i>

345
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,487
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

346
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,786
<i>DJ, Mac,
there's something down here.</i>

347
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,170
<i>Jonas was right!</i>

348
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:46,298
<i>Jonas was right!
Do you cop...</i>

349
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:47,919
It's Lori.

350
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,730
Your ex-wife and her
crew are trapped

351
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:52,587
below 11,000 meters.

352
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,619
I fear they
may have encountered

353
00:19:54,674 --> 00:19:56,640
the same species you did
down there.

354
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:00,315
I have divers with less
experience willing to go.

355
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:02,817
But I feel
I owe it to my crew

356
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:05,828
to give this rescue
the best chance of success.

357
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,532
Please...

358
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:20,270
Lori, hand me the hex key.

359
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:22,971
Thanks.

360
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:29,370
Okay.

361
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,219
Okay, if we can
short out the firewall,

362
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,685
I can... I can probably
reboot the computers.

363
00:20:37,451 --> 00:20:39,220
Okay, try it now.

364
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:45,816
Auxiliary power's back.

365
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:51,141
Heaters are online.

366
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:52,974
There's no way that we'll
get the engines started,

367
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:55,556
but we might be able to get
the ballast tanks back.

368
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:58,754
What are you doing,
taking notes?

369
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:00,753
A letter to my wife.

370
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,237
Just in case.

371
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,124
Hey...

372
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:08,596
We got this.

373
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:10,417
Step by step.

374
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:13,503
Come on, give me that
fighting octopus.

375
00:21:25,215 --> 00:21:27,586
See? Works every time!

376
00:21:34,372 --> 00:21:35,386
No.

377
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:36,966
What?

378
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:38,565
We gotta can the lights.

379
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:00,113
Turn off the lights.

380
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:02,667
<i>There was something
down there with us.</i>

381
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:03,746
<i>How can you be sure,</i>

382
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,931
<i>if there were no observation
windows on your craft?</i>

383
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:07,243
<i>'Cause whatever it was,</i>

384
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:10,009
<i>kicked in the entire starboard
side of a nuclear submarine.</i>

385
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:12,587
<i>It wasn't my imagination.</i>

386
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:14,420
<i>Is that why you
blew the hatch mid-rescue?</i>

387
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,075
<i>Hey, look,
I brought 11 men back.</i>

388
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,571
<i>Safe and sound.</i>

389
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,109
<i>And more to die
because you panicked.</i>

390
00:22:21,232 --> 00:22:23,269
<i>If I hadn't have
blown the hatch,</i>

391
00:22:23,315 --> 00:22:25,391
<i>we all would've been
killed by that thing.</i>

392
00:22:25,452 --> 00:22:26,805
<i>There was no "thing".</i>

393
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,634
<i>There was no evidence
of anything.</i>

394
00:22:28,696 --> 00:22:31,442
<i>Because it was destroyed
in the explosion, Heller!</i>

395
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:32,980
<i>Look, there was no time left!</i>

396
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:34,466
<i>So I made the call!</i>

397
00:22:34,515 --> 00:22:36,141
<i>And you left our
friends there to die</i>

398
00:22:36,215 --> 00:22:37,796
<i>in an act of cowardice!</i>

399
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:42,960
What do <i>you</i> think
happened down there?

400
00:22:43,338 --> 00:22:44,730
He lost it.

401
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,051
And now we're about to send him
into the exact same situation.

402
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,444
Excuse me, Suyin,

403
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:55,110
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but
we need you. It's an emergency.

404
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:57,657
What's wrong, Jaxx?

405
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,319
Now they're leaking oxygen.

406
00:22:59,363 --> 00:23:01,682
They've got a couple of hours,
maybe more.

407
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,564
I'm going.

408
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:05,698
- No.
- Wait, what?

409
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,057
I'll take one of the gliders,

410
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,292
drop to the Origin
and tow her up.

411
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:12,520
Wait, if the Origin's ballast tanks
blow, you're gonna die, too.

412
00:23:12,553 --> 00:23:14,047
We have to try.

413
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,058
Mommy?

414
00:23:21,722 --> 00:23:22,922
Meiying...

415
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:08,612
Good to go.

416
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:10,947
Suyin, you are go for launch.

417
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:37,432
<i>Auto-descent sequence initiated.</i>

418
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,923
- Hey, Meiying.
- Hi.

419
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:13,637
Sir, we've got a new problem.

420
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,764
It's your daughter.

421
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,845
She took a glider
to try and save them.

422
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:18,494
Why did you let her go?

423
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:20,546
Trust me, I didn't let her
do anything.

424
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:22,129
I was sort of under the
impression you're supposed to

425
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,608
try to save people who are dying
on the bottom of the ocean.

426
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:25,700
Who's he?

427
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,669
I'm the guy
who paid for all this.

428
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,778
Uh-huh.

429
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,409
You know, he looks heroic,
and he walks fast, but...

430
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,479
he's kinda got
a negative attitude.

431
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,651
What's the window?

432
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:41,972
It'll be close.

433
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:45,321
Who are you?

434
00:25:45,347 --> 00:25:47,133
I'm the one
that designed all this.

435
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:48,882
So my life's in your hands.

436
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,335
Pretty much.

437
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:51,767
That a problem?

438
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:52,921
Nah.

439
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:55,499
You look like you might actually
know what you're doin'.

440
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,490
Oh, I'm sorry.

441
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:02,793
Mac, have Dr. Heller meet
us in the medical bay.

442
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,406
Heller?

443
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,046
Did I not mention that?

444
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:14,307
He's in perfect shape.

445
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:17,043
Just like the last time
you examined me.

446
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,425
Suyin took the glider
15 minutes ago.

447
00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:22,566
She's planning on taking
the Origin back up.

448
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,981
Take me to the sub.

449
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:25,837
- You're not done here.
- Yeah, we are.

450
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,308
Lori's runnin' out of air.

451
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:30,098
And we're in international waters,
which means legally,

452
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:32,005
I can beat the ever
living shit out of you

453
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:33,451
and get away with it.

454
00:26:35,156 --> 00:26:36,276
It's true.

455
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,256
Well, legally, I mean.

456
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,054
Good thing he doesn't
hold a grudge.

457
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:43,521
Jonas, you do know
that the sub

458
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,253
is rated for 12,000
meters, right?

459
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:47,133
What, the one leaking
on the ocean floor?

460
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,741
Ah, good point.

461
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,982
- We good?
- Yep.

462
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:53,380
Once you strip back the safeties
and go full manual,

463
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,669
like I know you're gonna do,

464
00:26:54,724 --> 00:26:56,394
the system's gonna
have problems

465
00:26:56,451 --> 00:26:58,313
tryin' to keep up with
your pressure changes.

466
00:26:58,573 --> 00:27:00,380
Try not to blow your
ears out, brother.

467
00:27:00,712 --> 00:27:01,933
Thanks, mate.

468
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,619
Hello, skipper.

469
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,845
You must be the crazy guy.

470
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:22,582
Now, who called me that?

471
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:25,048
My mom, Dr. Heller.

472
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:28,196
You know, I'm not crazy.

473
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:30,981
I've just seen things
no one else has.

474
00:27:31,142 --> 00:27:33,565
That's the definition of crazy.

475
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,289
Backup power...
backup power.

476
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,269
So, where are your parents?

477
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,530
My mom's trying
to bring our friends

478
00:27:48,555 --> 00:27:50,826
back from the
bottom of the ocean.

479
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:54,930
My dad's with a
Pilates instructor in Taipei.

480
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,903
Granddad says
mom needs to move on,

481
00:27:57,939 --> 00:27:59,775
but mom says
she needs more time

482
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,816
because she was married
to an a-hole.

483
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:04,001
Sounds like
your mother's got a point.

484
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,510
You know a lot.

485
00:28:09,577 --> 00:28:12,232
Eight-year-olds hear everything.

486
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:16,039
Mind if I give it a try?

487
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,057
Bye.

488
00:28:25,736 --> 00:28:27,181
Hey, crazy.

489
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,301
Is my mom gonna die?

490
00:28:31,494 --> 00:28:34,325
I'll have Captain Bubbles
and your mom back in no time.

491
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:35,882
I promise.

492
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:42,427
Thank you, Emma.

493
00:28:42,502 --> 00:28:44,738
<i>Evolution launch:
T-minus 15 seconds.</i>

494
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,375
- DJ?
- Yeah.

495
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:48,398
Jaxx, we good?

496
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:49,687
Doc?

497
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:51,439
Evolution?

498
00:28:51,744 --> 00:28:53,349
We are go for dive.

499
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:58,183
Fancy.

500
00:29:06,502 --> 00:29:08,437

<i>Caution: Evolution

510
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:01,189
Why is he descending so fast?

511
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:03,769
Looks like he's diverted
all non-essential power,

512
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:06,220
like heat and life-support
to the motors.

513
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:07,708
He's gonna black out.

514
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:12,705
His blood gasses are dropping.

515
00:30:14,962 --> 00:30:16,073
Jonas...

516
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,008
<i>Tell Heller
I'm not slowin' down.</i>

517
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:30,639
<i>Suyin, be advised
Evolution is now en route.</i>

518
00:30:30,686 --> 00:30:32,573
Request you return
to Mana One immediately.

519
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:35,312
Negative, he can give us
an escort us on our way up.

520
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:37,166
Tell her to get out
of the way, Mac.

521
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:38,798
More people means more risk.

522
00:30:38,823 --> 00:30:40,172
<i>She's in way over her head.</i>

523
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,516
Jonas, you just
told her yourself.

524
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:45,342
What?

525
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:46,975
The little green button
on your intercom,

526
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:48,696
that's the single channel
communication.

527
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,880
Brilliant.

528
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:01,468
<i>Entering thermocline.</i>

529
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:14,995
<i>Okay, Mac, I am through.</i>

530
00:31:17,693 --> 00:31:21,430
<i>Warning: Pressure hold

531
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:23,658
<i>At this speed, I'm gonna have
to divert power from the heat</i>

532
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,033
and then shut down anything
that can ice over.

533
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,407
<i>Call you from the other side.</i>

534
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:33,690
You got Wi-Fi here?

535
00:31:37,537 --> 00:31:38,758
- Okay.
- Ungh!

536
00:31:39,124 --> 00:31:40,663
Just... just keep pressure on that.

537
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:42,417
Toshi, is it still out there?

538
00:31:42,478 --> 00:31:43,718
I can't tell.

539
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:45,692
I can't see anything right now.

540
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,278
There it is.

541
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:24,901
I've got visual of the Origin.

542
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:26,051
<i>I can see most of it.</i>

543
00:32:26,107 --> 00:32:27,877
Okay, they're alive.

544
00:32:27,901 --> 00:32:29,540
I'm going to
set up to tow.

545
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:35,719
<i>Range to target: Six meters.</i>

546
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:37,410
<i>Four meters.</i>

547
00:32:37,618 --> 00:32:38,790
<i>Target locked.</i>

548
00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:44,265
Firing magnetic hook...

549
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:45,458
Three...

550
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:46,551
Two...

551
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:01,959
Suyin?

552
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,077
Are you okay?
What's happening?

553
00:33:03,101 --> 00:33:05,744
<i>There... is something down here.</i>

554
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,927
<i>Something just hit my ship.</i>

555
00:33:22,854 --> 00:33:24,677
<i>Suyin?
What's happening?</i>

556
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:25,986
It's a huge squid.

557
00:33:26,022 --> 00:33:27,185
It's got the glider.

558
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,909
<i>Warning: Capsule pressure.</i>

559
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,804
<i>Mac, it's crushing me!
It's crushing me!</i>

560
00:33:31,856 --> 00:33:33,621
<i>I don't think the glider
can take it.</i>

561
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:35,002
It's not gonna hold.

562
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:40,120
<i>Suyin, engage
the pressure compensator.</i>

563
00:33:40,515 --> 00:33:42,394
<i>Compensator will not engage.</i>

564
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:44,738
<i>Capsule breach
in ten seconds.</i>

565
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:49,796
<i>Capsule breach
in five seconds.</i>

566
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:15,307
It's a shark.

567
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,547
<i>It's like, 20... 25 meters.</i>

568
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:19,012
It's a Megalodon.

569
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,429
<i>Impossible.</i>

570
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,690
<i>So glad I'm not crazy.</i>

571
00:34:30,657 --> 00:34:33,029
Suyin, power down.
It's drawn to the light.

572
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:35,450
Shut everything down
and stay dark.

573
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,680
<i>Shut down in 30 seconds.</i>

574
00:34:37,752 --> 00:34:39,378
<i>Shutting off everything
but comms.</i>

575
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,395
<i>It's circling back.
Here it comes, Suyin.</i>

576
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:43,706
<i>Shut down in 25 seconds.</i>

577
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:46,486
<i>Suyin, there's no time.
Turn off your lights.</i>

578
00:34:46,522 --> 00:34:48,555
<i>Shut down in 20 seconds.</i>

579
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:50,632
<i>Turn 'em off, now.</i>

580
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:52,578
<i>Shut down in 15 seconds.</i>

581
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:54,381
Mac, I have no control!

582
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:56,769
<i>Hurry.</i>

583
00:34:56,822 --> 00:34:59,266
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

584
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:02,624
<i>Seven, six, five...</i>

585
00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:24,606
<i>Now's your chance,
blow your tanks!</i>

586
00:35:24,631 --> 00:35:27,053
No. I can help you
save the crew.

587
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:29,419
<i>Your glider's damaged,
there's nothing you can do.</i>

588
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:31,809
Blow your tanks now!

589
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:33,935
Damn it.

590
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:43,579
<i>Dr. Zhang,
your daughter's clear.</i>

591
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,087
<i>I'm heading for the Origin now.</i>

592
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,317
<i>Range to target:
Three meters.</i>

593
00:36:05,053 --> 00:36:06,866
<i>Water extraction complete.</i>

594
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:17,436
Let's do this.

595
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:39,676
Ugh.

596
00:36:39,938 --> 00:36:42,499
Tell me this isn't
the world's best 'I told you so'.

597
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:45,882
You came all the way here
just to tell me that, didn't you?

598
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:47,136
Pretty much.

599
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:49,199
Give me your hand.

600
00:36:54,832 --> 00:36:56,204
Oh, that doesn't look good.

601
00:36:56,238 --> 00:36:57,669
Ready, one, two, three!

602
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,420
She's comin'.

603
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:03,091
Let's move.

604
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:06,802
If that thing hits us
while we're still attached...

605
00:37:06,882 --> 00:37:08,406
Then we're all gonna die.

606
00:37:16,713 --> 00:37:17,964
Come on, I've got you.

607
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,170
It's gonna be close.

608
00:37:20,265 --> 00:37:21,685
Come on, move, move!

609
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,486
Go, go, go!

610
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:27,739
We're not gonna make it!

611
00:37:28,984 --> 00:37:30,335
Toshi, hurry!

612
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,618
Toshi, no!

613
00:38:02,832 --> 00:38:04,401
<i>Come in, Evolution.</i>

614
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:06,820
<i>Jonas, come in.</i>

615
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,475
<i>Are you all okay?</i>

616
00:38:14,065 --> 00:38:16,245
<i>Dr. Heller has vitals on
Lori and The Wall</i>

617
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:17,869
<i>but we don't have Toshi.</i>

618
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:20,442
<i>Is Toshi okay?</i>

619
00:38:21,853 --> 00:38:23,795
<i>Jonas, is Toshi okay?</i>

620
00:38:25,782 --> 00:38:27,370
All right, nice and easy.

621
00:38:28,211 --> 00:38:29,475
Don't move her neck.

622
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,590
That's good.

623
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,754
- Grab a hold.
- We got her.

624
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:46,114
You couldn't bring Toshi back?

625
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:47,667
Why not?

626
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:49,298
He closed the hatch.

627
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:52,308
He saved us.

628
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:55,147
You left him.

629
00:38:57,648 --> 00:38:58,731
You left him

630
00:38:58,805 --> 00:39:00,402
because that's who you are.

631
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:02,684
You are the guy
who leaves people behind.

632
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:04,138
You go that deep,

633
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:06,364
you take your life
in your hands.

634
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:08,501
It was your choice
to send them down.

635
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:15,613
This is why I don't
do this anymore, Mac.

636
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,715
How is she?

637
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:35,782
The puncture just missed her
liver. She lost a lot of blood.

638
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:37,473
But she's stable.

639
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:46,764
Jonas.

640
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,978
I'm sorry.

641
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,463
I was wrong.

642
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:57,853
You saved Lori.

643
00:39:58,965 --> 00:40:00,450
We can call it even.

644
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:30,204
I just want to apologize
for before.

645
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:32,702
I was angry
and I lose my temper.

646
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:34,723
And you did save my...

647
00:40:36,196 --> 00:40:37,526
You're naked.

648
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:45,037
I know you did
all you could, so...

649
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,490
Thank you.

650
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:48,609
Yeah.

651
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:50,187
You're welcome.

652
00:40:51,142 --> 00:40:53,517
I know it's not easy being
the person who survives.

653
00:40:56,642 --> 00:40:58,287
I'm gonna go now.

654
00:40:58,512 --> 00:40:59,904
You should put
on some clothes.

655
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:00,930
Yep.

656
00:41:00,955 --> 00:41:02,156
That's the original plan.

657
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,123
Okay, then. Carry on.

658
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:25,402
Hi.

659
00:41:25,506 --> 00:41:28,223
- Uh, I-I was...
- It's all good.

660
00:41:30,228 --> 00:41:32,751
Jonas and Lori were the worst
married couple ever, you know.

661
00:41:32,785 --> 00:41:33,842
Huh?

662
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:35,787
Whole experiment
was over in a year.

663
00:41:37,326 --> 00:41:38,785
I didn't ask anything.

664
00:41:40,173 --> 00:41:41,455
I know.

665
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,720
This is what attacked us.

666
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:50,920
A megalodon.

667
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,525
How big is that thing?

668
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:54,737
Between 70 and 90 feet.

669
00:41:54,876 --> 00:41:56,699
21 to 27 meters.

670
00:41:56,815 --> 00:42:00,647
The megalodon was the largest
shark that ever existed.

671
00:42:00,964 --> 00:42:02,455
It feared nothing.

672
00:42:02,944 --> 00:42:04,946
It had no predators.

673
00:42:05,447 --> 00:42:08,768
Its jaws was stronger
than any other animal ever.

674
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:11,575
The meg could bite
a whale in half,

675
00:42:11,643 --> 00:42:13,289
crushing through the bones.

676
00:42:13,655 --> 00:42:15,617
We are in uncharted territory.

677
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:16,956
Until today,

678
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:19,276
megalodons were thought
to have been extinct

679
00:42:19,307 --> 00:42:21,184
for over two million years.

680
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,355
Wrong.

681
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:23,671
A living fossil.

682
00:42:23,705 --> 00:42:26,624
That living fossil
ate my friend.

683
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:31,662
I cannot begin to express
my sadness for Toshi's death.

684
00:42:31,697 --> 00:42:33,821
We have the discovery
of a lifetime.

685
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,000
This is what Toshi worked for.

686
00:42:38,214 --> 00:42:39,983
It's what we've all worked for.

687
00:42:40,082 --> 00:42:42,786
But we're going to
have to proceed slowly.

688
00:42:42,968 --> 00:42:45,978
Yeah, that's really
not gonna work for me.

689
00:42:49,044 --> 00:42:50,870
What is Mana One?

690
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,238
This station?

691
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,240
Yes. And what's it doing?

692
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,911
Hmm? Right now?

693
00:43:00,157 --> 00:43:01,506
Exactly.

694
00:43:01,714 --> 00:43:02,990
Nothing.

695
00:43:03,466 --> 00:43:05,594
$20 million rover, gone.

696
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,171
$30 million sub, gone.

697
00:43:08,274 --> 00:43:10,373
You are now sitting
in the most expensive

698
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,458
underwater marine biology
day camp in human history.

699
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,959
Hey, crazy.

700
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:19,933
And now that we've actually
found something amazing,

701
00:43:20,733 --> 00:43:23,077
we can't proceed slowly.

702
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,058
Thank you for
keeping your promise.

703
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:26,393
You don't quit

704
00:43:26,418 --> 00:43:27,827
- trying to get to the moon.
- You're welcome.

705
00:43:27,851 --> 00:43:29,087
because you lose an astronaut.

706
00:43:29,598 --> 00:43:31,179
You charge forward.

707
00:43:31,497 --> 00:43:33,512
Or someone else'll
get there first.

708
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:37,687
Other people will
want a piece of this thing.

709
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:39,699
Whether we like it or not.

710
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,880
You seem to like it.

711
00:43:43,656 --> 00:43:45,495
- Excuse me?
- I said...

712
00:43:45,597 --> 00:43:47,160
You seem to like it.

713
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,105
I'm sorry,
is he part of this team?

714
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,111
You're damn right,
he's a part of this team.

715
00:43:52,512 --> 00:43:53,529
Okay.

716
00:43:54,084 --> 00:43:57,005
You ever think that Mother Nature
might know what she's doing?

717
00:43:57,984 --> 00:44:01,647
The thermocline might just
be there for a reason?

718
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:04,575
Hey, look, you want to explore,

719
00:44:04,636 --> 00:44:06,459
go ahead, explore.

720
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:10,458
If you start sending
people back down there,

721
00:44:10,743 --> 00:44:13,213
don't call me
to come save your asses.

722
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:16,706
'Cause in case what happened
down there wasn't clear to you,

723
00:44:16,845 --> 00:44:19,397
man versus meg isn't a fight.

724
00:44:19,861 --> 00:44:21,340
It's a slaughter.

725
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,418
<i>O level.</i>

726
00:45:17,597 --> 00:45:19,073
What you people discovered

727
00:45:19,114 --> 00:45:22,535
is an even bigger gold mine
than we ever thought possible!

728
00:45:22,564 --> 00:45:24,645
We are completely unprepared

729
00:45:24,701 --> 00:45:26,568
to deal with creatures
like megalodon.

730
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:27,990
I understand.
We can get prepared.

731
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:29,667
- I'm talking about a long-term...
- You don't understand.

732
00:45:29,691 --> 00:45:31,487
- We can't promise things...
- This shark...

733
00:46:23,142 --> 00:46:25,016
That's gonna be
the other alternative.

734
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,368
What's that?

735
00:46:33,587 --> 00:46:34,696
My daughter.

736
00:46:44,244 --> 00:46:46,450
- Jonas!
- Did you see Meiying?

737
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,878
Meiying?

738
00:46:48,763 --> 00:46:49,796
Meiying?

739
00:46:49,837 --> 00:46:51,051
- Check this way
- Meiying.

740
00:46:57,624 --> 00:46:58,744
Meiying.

741
00:46:59,175 --> 00:47:00,404
Meiying!

742
00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:03,294
- Meiying.
- Mama!

743
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:05,590
Oh, it's...

744
00:47:06,397 --> 00:47:07,600
Are you okay?

745
00:47:08,624 --> 00:47:12,171
There's a monster
and it's watching us.

746
00:47:32,523 --> 00:47:34,353
It's okay, it's just a whale.

747
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:37,673
Wait. Where's Ruthie?

748
00:47:38,404 --> 00:47:39,802
Where's the mom?

749
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,164
Is the station all right?
Report.

750
00:47:56,472 --> 00:47:58,096
No leaks,
no visible damage.

751
00:47:58,157 --> 00:48:00,546
All right, team, initiate
emergency protocols.

752
00:48:00,582 --> 00:48:02,362
And nobody is to go
near the water.

753
00:48:02,387 --> 00:48:03,407
If you insist.

754
00:48:03,443 --> 00:48:04,993
It's going for the
underwater lighting.

755
00:48:05,024 --> 00:48:07,019
Let's cut the crew
to essential areas.

756
00:48:07,373 --> 00:48:09,838
You said it was impossible
for it to get up here.

757
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,387
It should have been.

758
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:13,098
You guys, take a look at this.

759
00:48:13,415 --> 00:48:14,746
When the glider came up,

760
00:48:14,802 --> 00:48:16,538
the thermocline was intact, so

761
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:18,534
it was one degree
Celsius, right?

762
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,149
- Yeah.
- But a minute later,

763
00:48:20,181 --> 00:48:21,408
when the Evolution came up,

764
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:23,952
the temperature
increased by 25 degrees.

765
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,914
A shark could come
right through there.

766
00:48:25,979 --> 00:48:27,605
20 sharks, for that matter.

767
00:48:27,715 --> 00:48:30,713
When the meg hit the Origin,
it slammed into a thermal vent.

768
00:48:30,786 --> 00:48:33,473
Those can release millions
of gallons per minute.

769
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,801
The heat from that vent

770
00:48:34,844 --> 00:48:37,053
cleared a path through
the freezing cold layer.

771
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,715
Are you saying we opened up a
super highway for giant sharks?

772
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:42,484
Not exactly, i-it seemed like
it was a transitory event.

773
00:48:42,525 --> 00:48:44,380
The temperatures are 
returned to normal

774
00:48:44,423 --> 00:48:45,765
and the gap is closed.

775
00:48:45,811 --> 00:48:48,872
Yeah, but not before a massive
prehistoric killing machine

776
00:48:48,915 --> 00:48:50,734
decided to come up and say, 'hi!'

777
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:53,195
Well, look, we're wasting time,
that thing's out there.

778
00:48:53,279 --> 00:48:54,944
We need to find it
and kill it.

779
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:56,141
No!

780
00:48:56,214 --> 00:48:57,594
We can't!

781
00:48:57,653 --> 00:49:00,443
We should explore
non-lethal options first.

782
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,482
For the meg or for us?

783
00:49:04,618 --> 00:49:05,662
<i>Attention...</i>

784
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:07,585
I've got an emergency
locator beacon!

785
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,558
20 miles, south, southwest.

786
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,721
What does that mean?

787
00:49:10,794 --> 00:49:12,424
It means a boat has gone down.

788
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,384
- Three boats.
- That's the meg.

789
00:49:16,006 --> 00:49:17,745
I need to get there, now.

790
00:49:32,955 --> 00:49:35,452
Mac! I found something!

791
00:49:54,288 --> 00:49:55,952
These sharks have no fins.

792
00:49:55,995 --> 00:49:57,765
They were killed
by shark poachers.

793
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:01,742
They cut off the fins
and throw the shark back to die.

794
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:04,432
All for a bowl of soup.

795
00:50:04,822 --> 00:50:07,125
Looks like the meg
evened the score.

796
00:50:11,687 --> 00:50:14,002
One fish did all this?

797
00:50:14,955 --> 00:50:16,245
Ask her yourself.

798
00:50:19,312 --> 00:50:22,907
Okay. We have a shark cage
and spearguns on board.

799
00:50:22,998 --> 00:50:24,424
If we can shoot the meg

800
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:26,647
in a soft spot
like its mouth or gills,

801
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,531
we can inject it
with something lethal.

802
00:50:28,556 --> 00:50:29,636
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

803
00:50:29,661 --> 00:50:31,903
It's gonna take at least
20 minutes to rig the cage.

804
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:33,490
And that thing
will be gone in two.

805
00:50:33,521 --> 00:50:35,560
Why don't you just
put a tracker on it?

806
00:50:37,564 --> 00:50:39,346
Don't you guys ever watch
<i>Shark Week</i>?

807
00:50:39,408 --> 00:50:41,687
You have one of those,
like, GPS

808
00:50:41,776 --> 00:50:44,029
tracker... tag... thingamajigs?

809
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:46,159
Keep an eye on the shark
till the cage is ready.

810
00:50:46,183 --> 00:50:49,036
We should be able to put a
tracking dart on that dorsal fin.

811
00:50:49,062 --> 00:50:50,277
You're welcome.

812
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:52,323
Yeah, but somehow,
we have to get

813
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:53,550
this boat next to that meg.

814
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:54,893
No, we can't.

815
00:50:55,133 --> 00:50:57,422
It's already proven
aggressive towards boats.

816
00:50:57,507 --> 00:51:00,395
The safest way to approach
is without a vehicle.

817
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:01,693
Hold up, hold up.

818
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,160
You want someone
to swim out there?

819
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,336
To a prehistoric shark
that ate our friend?

820
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:08,245
Actually, one of us alone
in the water is no threat.

821
00:51:08,342 --> 00:51:11,022
Okay, who the hell
is gonna make that swim?

822
00:51:12,885 --> 00:51:14,250
Let's draw straws.

823
00:51:14,346 --> 00:51:15,651
I can't swim.

824
00:51:18,273 --> 00:51:20,691
Uh, sorry.

825
00:51:21,132 --> 00:51:22,780
My body made me say that.

826
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,302
You sure about this?

827
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,764
Not really.

828
00:51:31,351 --> 00:51:33,854
If I get eaten,
you'd feel really bad.

829
00:51:39,977 --> 00:51:42,498
This tracker rifle
only has 100-foot range.

830
00:51:43,757 --> 00:51:45,061
100 feet?

831
00:51:45,172 --> 00:51:47,003
Get really close
before you shoot.

832
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,133
Great.

833
00:51:49,325 --> 00:51:51,177
D'you want me to go instead?
I will.

834
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,022
I got this, Mac.

835
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,080
'Kay, good, 'cause I was lying.

836
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:57,741
- Be safe.
- Yeah, thanks, pal.

837
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:03,108
I hope you're right about this.

838
00:52:03,785 --> 00:52:05,186
Me too.

839
00:52:17,197 --> 00:52:18,650
I'm an idiot.

840
00:52:30,811 --> 00:52:32,603
I'm proceeding

841
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,368
<i>to the enormous killer shark.</i>

842
00:52:34,398 --> 00:52:36,245
Yeah, we got you, Jonas.

00:52:36,378 --> 00:52:38,955
<i>Sharks are attracted

844
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:40,947
<i>Keep it nice and smooth.</i>

845
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:53,006

He's done it.

851
00:54:18,564 --> 00:54:20,261
Mac! The tracker is live!

852
00:54:20,346 --> 00:54:22,033
Great. Reel him in, DJ!

853
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,151
Stop! Stop!

854
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,972
No vibration!

855
00:54:33,149 --> 00:54:35,364
Ah, shit. I'm in trouble.

857
00:54:37,127 --> 00:54:38,776
You think I didn't notice?!

858
00:54:39,884 --> 00:54:41,593
Start the boat!
Start the boat!

859
00:54:47,553 --> 00:54:48,598
Pull him in!

860
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,619
- Come on, hurry!
- Come on!

861
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:27,844
You might be a son of a bitch,

862
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:29,858
but you're sure as hell
no coward.

863
00:55:30,446 --> 00:55:31,746
Good job.

864
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:50,759
I've prepared the spearheads
to inject etorphine.

865
00:55:50,991 --> 00:55:53,580
A killer whale is knocked
out with 10ccs.

866
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:55,066
Dead with 20.

867
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,508
What do you think?

868
00:55:56,577 --> 00:55:58,620
I think we use
the whole damn bottle.

869
00:56:00,651 --> 00:56:03,406
Remind me again
why this is a good idea.

870
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,481
What? It's a shark cage.

871
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,875
Plastic shark cage.

872
00:56:08,151 --> 00:56:10,234
I'm gonna ignore
that you just said that.

873
00:56:10,697 --> 00:56:12,784
This beautiful thing
is polycarbonate,

874
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:15,104
specifically designed not to crack,

875
00:56:15,185 --> 00:56:16,576
not to break,

876
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:18,137
but to deform.

877
00:56:18,266 --> 00:56:20,232
And in this case,
at this thickness,

878
00:56:20,279 --> 00:56:24,025
it would take 20,000 pounds
per square inch.

879
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,779
If you're talking
about breaking,

880
00:56:25,858 --> 00:56:28,862
that's 8 to 900,000.

881
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:33,360
I don't like it.

882
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,088
He doesn't like it.

883
00:56:39,235 --> 00:56:40,804
I wouldn't get in there.

884
00:56:42,947 --> 00:56:44,192
Keep it coming.

885
00:56:48,183 --> 00:56:49,475
That's good!

886
00:56:57,453 --> 00:56:58,589
Hey.

887
00:56:59,577 --> 00:57:01,030
What'd he say?

888
00:57:02,004 --> 00:57:03,498
He said, 'Be careful.'

889
00:57:03,578 --> 00:57:05,397
That's his version of
'I love you'.

890
00:57:06,112 --> 00:57:07,974
Your father has
a lot of faith in you.

891
00:57:08,406 --> 00:57:10,464
I've done hundreds
of shark dives.

892
00:57:12,591 --> 00:57:14,195
Not like this.

893
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:16,303
Yes.

894
00:57:17,374 --> 00:57:19,117
But I know shark anatomy.

895
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:20,653
And I know where this

896
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:22,900
can penetrate the
megalodon's skin.

897
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,640
- Suyin, let me go, it's...
- Hey.

898
00:57:28,759 --> 00:57:31,819
Don't worry about me.
Let me do what I do best.

899
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,871
<i>Everything okay up there?</i>

900
00:58:19,987 --> 00:58:21,513
<i>Just a fresh round of chum.</i>

901
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,713
So you'd... you know,
taste good.

902
00:58:25,456 --> 00:58:27,424
<i>I'm so glad
you're looking out for me.</i>

903
00:58:27,862 --> 00:58:29,479
Thank you. Bye-bye. Good luck.

904
00:58:56,841 --> 00:58:59,043
<i>What's happening down there?
You okay?</i>

905
00:58:59,575 --> 00:59:01,522
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

906
00:59:01,869 --> 00:59:04,228
Just some teeny, tiny,
eight-foot sharks.

907
00:59:12,229 --> 00:59:13,547
<i>Here we go.</i>

908
00:59:16,413 --> 00:59:17,536
We've got her attention.

909
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,438
Suyin, it's on its way.

910
00:59:19,574 --> 00:59:21,320
- 50 meters!
- 50 meters.

911
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:25,317
<i>30.</i>

912
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,241
<i>10 meters.</i>

913
00:59:46,352 --> 00:59:47,432
<i>Okay.</i>

914
00:59:48,937 --> 00:59:49,985
<i>Wow.</i>

915
00:59:51,377 --> 00:59:53,337
<i>I'm going to try
to hit it in the eye.</i>

916
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,020
<i>Damn it!</i>

917
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:10,539
Go!

918
01:00:22,433 --> 01:00:23,625
Shit!

919
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,434
<i>Yes, the poison is in!</i>

920
01:00:35,068 --> 01:00:36,595
<i>Okay, Suyin, hang in there.</i>

921
01:00:41,283 --> 01:00:43,273
<i>I'm trapped!
I'm in its mouth!</i>

922
01:00:43,312 --> 01:00:44,657
That cage will not break.

923
01:00:44,785 --> 01:00:46,279
<i>That's the problem!</i>

924
01:00:46,328 --> 01:00:48,123
<i>The cage is being swallowed!</i>

925
01:01:01,923 --> 01:01:03,360
Hell, yeah!

926
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,125
- Not this again.
- I know, man.

927
01:01:43,148 --> 01:01:45,699
<i>New problem...
my mask is broken.</i>

928
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:47,702
<i>I'm losing air!</i>

929
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:55,334
Help!

930
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:00,313
Help!

931
01:02:05,508 --> 01:02:06,819
Come on, Jaxx!

932
01:02:12,123 --> 01:02:13,905
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

933
01:02:19,568 --> 01:02:21,506
<i>No, Jonas! Go!</i>

934
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,090
<i>Get back to the ship!</i>

935
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,552
<i>It's not safe for you.</i>

936
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,754
<i>Jonas, go back.</i>

937
01:02:31,144 --> 01:02:32,352
<i>Jonas.</i>

938
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,879
<i>Jonas, the crane's in the water!</i>

939
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:47,540
<i>It's gonna pull her
to the bottom! Hurry!</i>

940
01:02:51,028 --> 01:02:52,554
Swing the second crane over.

941
01:02:53,077 --> 01:02:55,850
We're gonna set a trap.
Guys, I need some bait.

942
01:03:17,712 --> 01:03:18,866
Come on.

943
01:03:20,137 --> 01:03:21,174
Whoa!

944
01:04:10,172 --> 01:04:11,501
Over here!

945
01:04:13,425 --> 01:04:15,173
This way, throw the rope!

946
01:04:17,263 --> 01:04:18,493
She's not breathing.

947
01:05:04,106 --> 01:05:06,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
take it easy.

948
01:05:06,499 --> 01:05:07,856
You were dead a minute ago.

949
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,456
Doctor...

950
01:05:14,021 --> 01:05:15,547
You got me out.

951
01:05:16,602 --> 01:05:18,448
It was closer than
I woulda liked.

952
01:05:20,837 --> 01:05:22,760
Can I have a minute with Jonas?

953
01:05:23,862 --> 01:05:25,009
Sure.

954
01:05:38,289 --> 01:05:39,913
You saved me

955
01:05:40,042 --> 01:05:41,428
again.

956
01:05:42,412 --> 01:05:43,970
I prefer you alive.

957
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,890
There's something
you might wanna see.

958
01:05:53,262 --> 01:05:54,282
Wow.

959
01:06:04,312 --> 01:06:06,705
- Hey, look who's up.
- Hey.

960
01:06:06,795 --> 01:06:08,906
- How are ya?
- I'm better.

961
01:06:09,017 --> 01:06:10,538
Thank you.

962
01:06:10,906 --> 01:06:14,038
Jonas, get a picture of me
with this big, smelly beast.

963
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:16,346
Okay, wait... Here.

964
01:06:16,426 --> 01:06:18,652
Hey, you want a proper picture,
get your head inside.

965
01:06:19,899 --> 01:06:21,358
- Closer.
- Closer?

966
01:06:21,383 --> 01:06:22,582
Come on, get in!

967
01:06:22,736 --> 01:06:23,931
Okay.

968
01:06:30,548 --> 01:06:31,705
Nice one!

969
01:06:32,162 --> 01:06:34,369
Yo, Jonas,
please tell me you got that!

970
01:06:34,433 --> 01:06:35,923
I got that, DJ!

971
01:06:37,132 --> 01:06:38,707
That's not funny, man!

972
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,722
No, like, seriously, it's funny.
Look, watch this.

973
01:06:43,423 --> 01:06:45,193
♪ We got The Wall in the water ♪

974
01:06:46,038 --> 01:06:47,736
♪ We got The Wall in the water ♪

975
01:06:48,626 --> 01:06:50,119
♪ We got The Wall in the water ♪

976
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:51,444
Hey, Suyin.

977
01:06:52,954 --> 01:06:54,557
Here, next to the meg.

978
01:06:56,047 --> 01:06:57,048
Look.

979
01:06:57,158 --> 01:06:59,228
Remember the bite marks
on the O level?

980
01:06:59,936 --> 01:07:01,523
Well, how do you like that?

981
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:04,081
That was serious
man versus nature moment.

982
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:06,092
I'm just glad
things went our way.

983
01:07:07,597 --> 01:07:09,429
It didn't go our way.

984
01:07:10,521 --> 01:07:12,209
Not for Toshi.

985
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,347
And not for science.

986
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:18,801
We did what people always do.

987
01:07:19,152 --> 01:07:20,460
Discover...

988
01:07:20,839 --> 01:07:22,451
and then destroy.

989
01:07:23,798 --> 01:07:25,056
Ecch.

990
01:07:27,091 --> 01:07:28,507
Hey, I will end you.

991
01:07:28,556 --> 01:07:30,526
At least you can use this
as your date in that pic.

992
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,371
- Gimme a little leg, you know?
- Yeah.

993
01:07:32,408 --> 01:07:33,415
Whoo!

994
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:36,080
Oh yeah, jellyfish!

995
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:18,581
No! There's two?

996
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:20,959
Nobody said there were two!

997
01:08:21,386 --> 01:08:22,979
How are there two?!

998
01:08:23,214 --> 01:08:25,369
Hey, get me out of this water!
Help!

999
01:08:25,453 --> 01:08:27,161
Somebody help, please!

1000
01:08:27,258 --> 01:08:28,302
Help!

1001
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,274
What is wrong with you?

1002
01:08:30,341 --> 01:08:32,130
I can't... I can't swim!

1003
01:08:32,293 --> 01:08:34,244
Now, get outta here! Really?

1004
01:08:34,269 --> 01:08:35,962
Don't pull that
racist stuff on me!

1005
01:08:36,057 --> 01:08:38,794
Come on, man! Gimme a break.
I'm not being racist!

1006
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:40,668
You work, literally

1007
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:42,723
in the middle of the ocean!

1008
01:08:43,205 --> 01:08:45,006
This wasn't part
of the job description.

1009
01:08:45,104 --> 01:08:47,247
None of this was part
of the job description!

1010
01:08:47,485 --> 01:08:49,160
They left that part out!

1011
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,585
Pa!

1012
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:53,303
No!

1013
01:08:55,668 --> 01:08:57,036
Pa!

1014
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:02,055
It's time to get some real help.

1015
01:09:02,085 --> 01:09:03,638
Yeah. Go get some help.

1016
01:09:03,698 --> 01:09:04,876
Pa!

1017
01:09:05,471 --> 01:09:07,231
- Pa!
- I'm quittin'.

1018
01:09:07,367 --> 01:09:09,786
Mac, give me a hand!

1019
01:09:11,768 --> 01:09:12,781
Pa.

1020
01:09:14,858 --> 01:09:17,848
Hey, I need you
to find my location.

1021
01:09:18,018 --> 01:09:20,070
Track my sat phone.
There's a second shark.

1022
01:09:20,411 --> 01:09:21,566
Yes, two.

1023
01:09:22,005 --> 01:09:23,425
How the hell should I know?!

1024
01:09:23,502 --> 01:09:25,462
Just hurry up
and get us some help.

1025
01:09:25,848 --> 01:09:27,845
Thank you, Jonas.
Thank you.

1026
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,860
- Oh!
- Just relax, relax.

1027
01:09:30,315 --> 01:09:31,711
It's not good.

1028
01:09:31,888 --> 01:09:33,689
He needs a hospital fast.

1029
01:09:33,778 --> 01:09:35,893
Let's get the doctor.
Where's Dr. Heller?

1030
01:09:37,862 --> 01:09:38,862
Mac!

1031
01:09:39,535 --> 01:09:41,509
Jaxx! You okay?

1032
01:09:41,534 --> 01:09:42,804
Yeah!

1033
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:48,778
Jaxx, we can do this!

1034
01:09:49,582 --> 01:09:51,303
Swim gently back to the boat.

1035
01:09:51,978 --> 01:09:53,361
Nice and easy.

1036
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,261
Here it comes!

1037
01:10:00,637 --> 01:10:01,754
Heller!

1038
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,824
We're not gonna make it.

1039
01:10:05,564 --> 01:10:08,240
Jaxx, you're gonna be okay.

1040
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:09,948
You're a good person, Jaxx.

1041
01:10:10,031 --> 01:10:11,307
Wait, what?

1042
01:10:12,064 --> 01:10:13,287
Don't look back.

1043
01:10:13,357 --> 01:10:15,096
- Hey!
- No!

1044
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,000
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

1045
01:10:17,114 --> 01:10:18,549
Hey! Come on!

1046
01:10:19,403 --> 01:10:20,496
Hey!

1047
01:10:20,752 --> 01:10:22,260
Hey, come on!

1048
01:10:26,482 --> 01:10:27,587
No!

1049
01:10:37,578 --> 01:10:38,738
Almost there!

1050
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:47,070
It's okay, Jaxx.

1051
01:10:47,705 --> 01:10:49,116
Are you okay?

1052
01:10:56,645 --> 01:10:58,269
Thank you, Dr. Heller.

1053
01:10:58,641 --> 01:10:59,869
Thank you.

1054
01:11:01,426 --> 01:11:02,709
What was that?

1055
01:11:02,872 --> 01:11:04,124
What the hell was that?

1056
01:11:04,173 --> 01:11:06,316
- Okay, come on, DJ.
- No! No!

1057
01:11:06,371 --> 01:11:08,645
This is why we don't leave
the station, okay?

1058
01:11:08,704 --> 01:11:10,061
That's why you don't do that.

1059
01:11:10,086 --> 01:11:12,455
And you went down there
and you pissed it off.

1060
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:15,133
Now it's gonna come back
and kill every one of us!

1061
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:16,407
Now what're we supposed to do?

1062
01:11:16,431 --> 01:11:18,123
I shouldn't even be out here
in the first place!

1063
01:11:18,147 --> 01:11:19,734
Swimmin' in this ocean.

1064
01:11:19,782 --> 01:11:21,339
That one ate the other one.

1065
01:11:21,407 --> 01:11:23,267
Is another one
gonna eat this one?

1066
01:11:23,292 --> 01:11:24,379
Man, it's...

1067
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:27,890
It just killed Heller.

1068
01:11:28,225 --> 01:11:29,776
It killed The Wall.

1069
01:11:30,092 --> 01:11:31,590
It killed Toshi.

1070
01:11:33,671 --> 01:11:35,284
These my friends, man.

1071
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:47,482
Okay, can I just point out
that this thing is sinking?

1072
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:48,737
What are we gonna do now?

1073
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,013
Where's Mac?

1074
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,074
Yes!

1075
01:12:20,651 --> 01:12:22,168
What happened to your hair?

1076
01:12:22,535 --> 01:12:24,092
What happened to <i>your</i> hair?

1077
01:12:24,769 --> 01:12:25,994
Touché.

1078
01:12:27,795 --> 01:12:28,934
Guys!

1079
01:12:31,632 --> 01:12:33,274
That thing is the devil!

1080
01:12:34,281 --> 01:12:36,040
Ten miles, it's still with us.

1081
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,514
You got us?

1082
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,469
The ocean! The middle
of the frickin' ocean!

1083
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,082
You think it'd slow down
the shark if we threw him over?

1084
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:47,021
You gotta work on yourself.

1085
01:12:47,094 --> 01:12:48,947
Okay, good news, guys.

1086
01:12:49,158 --> 01:12:50,556
It's payback time!

1087
01:12:51,627 --> 01:12:54,026
Oh, ho! Yeah!

1088
01:13:26,181 --> 01:13:27,924
Yes! Get some!

1089
01:13:27,996 --> 01:13:30,413
You seriously think that a rifle
is gonna hurt that thing?

1090
01:13:30,518 --> 01:13:32,524
I didn't have much notice, okay?

1091
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,539
I just wanted
to get it off our backs.

1092
01:13:35,752 --> 01:13:37,189
Well done, Morris.

1093
01:13:37,337 --> 01:13:38,381
Whoo!

1094
01:15:29,247 --> 01:15:30,297
Mommy!

1095
01:15:30,499 --> 01:15:31,703
Mommy!

1096
01:15:32,836 --> 01:15:34,353
Welcome back, Mommy.

1097
01:16:23,973 --> 01:16:25,047
Come in.

1098
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:32,144
How's Meiying?

1099
01:16:34,088 --> 01:16:35,425
She's sad.

1100
01:16:35,964 --> 01:16:37,465
And confused.

1101
01:16:39,694 --> 01:16:41,007
How are you?

1102
01:16:42,988 --> 01:16:45,369
I really don't want to accept it.

1103
01:16:48,195 --> 01:16:50,328
Sometimes things happen that

1104
01:16:50,512 --> 01:16:52,203
change your life forever.

1105
01:16:53,389 --> 01:16:55,549
Meanwhile, the world
just keeps going.

1106
01:16:56,134 --> 01:16:57,661
You'd think maybe it would stop.

1107
01:16:58,449 --> 01:17:00,067
Just for a second.

1108
01:17:02,823 --> 01:17:04,367
But it doesn't.

1109
01:17:04,641 --> 01:17:06,516
How do you live with it?

1110
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:09,656
I don't.

1111
01:17:10,151 --> 01:17:13,039
I left my two best friends
to die.

1112
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:15,668
I think about it all the time.

1113
01:17:16,779 --> 01:17:18,354
Everyday, I replay it.

1114
01:17:19,664 --> 01:17:21,355
Could I have done more?

1115
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:25,695
It's not just about
the ones you lose.

1116
01:17:27,391 --> 01:17:29,008
It's also about

1117
01:17:29,094 --> 01:17:30,847
the ones you save.

1118
01:17:36,602 --> 01:17:38,049
I'm glad you're here.

1119
01:17:51,105 --> 01:17:53,464
I've informed the Chinese
government about the meg.

1120
01:17:53,803 --> 01:17:56,559
As well as the
authorities in Thailand,

1121
01:17:56,613 --> 01:17:58,933
Vietnam, Indonesia
and Australia.

1122
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:02,175
The Chinese are sending
two destroyers to take it out.

1123
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,385
So, this is now

1124
01:18:04,456 --> 01:18:08,448
officially and thankfully
out of our hands.

1125
01:18:10,828 --> 01:18:12,636
I'm closing Mana One

1126
01:18:13,467 --> 01:18:15,129
until the meg is killed.

1127
01:18:15,268 --> 01:18:17,631
And an evacuation ship

1128
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:19,510
is coming here
tomorrow morning.

1129
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:20,995
You're damn right.

1130
01:18:21,851 --> 01:18:24,409
And finally, I just want to say...

1131
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,549
I'm sorry

1132
01:18:31,343 --> 01:18:33,040
for your losses.

1133
01:18:33,885 --> 01:18:35,306
Your friends.

1134
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,775
I came here to celebrate with you.

1135
01:18:42,436 --> 01:18:44,652
But now I'm mourning with you.

1136
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,130
Thanks for savin' our asses!

1137
01:19:09,855 --> 01:19:11,420
What do you got for me?

1138
01:19:11,976 --> 01:19:14,993
These are Semtex high-velocity
demolition charges.

1139
01:19:15,087 --> 01:19:17,988
I had the men rig delayed fuses
to give 'em time to sink.

1140
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:20,667
Essentially, they're depth charges.

1141
01:19:22,414 --> 01:19:23,725
That's right.

1142
01:19:24,244 --> 01:19:27,308
I'm not sure this is a
advisable course of action.

1143
01:19:27,386 --> 01:19:30,268
Every person that gets maimed
or killed by that thing

1144
01:19:30,294 --> 01:19:32,138
is a potential lawsuit.

1145
01:19:32,221 --> 01:19:33,827
A potential casualty.

1146
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:35,942
Relax, bro.

1147
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:37,932
It's gonna be fun.

1148
01:19:41,853 --> 01:19:43,154
I can see your cards.

1149
01:19:43,197 --> 01:19:44,465
Oh, look at you two crooks.

1150
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:45,613
Hey.

1151
01:19:45,986 --> 01:19:47,575
How you feelin'?

1152
01:19:47,957 --> 01:19:50,651
Like I got off easy compared
to the rest of you guys.

1153
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:52,505
Hmm.

1154
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:54,408
What do you got up there?

1155
01:19:54,633 --> 01:19:56,824
- Three kings.
- What?

1156
01:19:56,898 --> 01:19:58,617
Come on, every time!

1157
01:19:59,098 --> 01:20:01,137
You owe me a soda
for that one.

1158
01:20:01,319 --> 01:20:02,364
Fine!

1159
01:20:03,109 --> 01:20:04,941
We'll square up
when you get back, okay?

1160
01:20:05,025 --> 01:20:07,454
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1161
01:20:08,035 --> 01:20:09,995
Just trying to take her
mind off things, you know?

1162
01:20:10,029 --> 01:20:11,794
She's tougher than me,
that's for sure.

1163
01:20:15,825 --> 01:20:17,373
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

1164
01:20:17,983 --> 01:20:19,961
Well, you didn't call me crazy.

1165
01:20:20,353 --> 01:20:22,254
Yeah, but I didn't call you sane.

1166
01:20:22,336 --> 01:20:25,309
Yeah, well, 'sane' wasn't a word
I heard very often.

1167
01:20:27,401 --> 01:20:28,835
So, what now?

1168
01:20:29,308 --> 01:20:30,482
I don't know.

1169
01:20:30,537 --> 01:20:32,040
Go back to Thailand, I guess.

1170
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:34,008
Mac told me about you and Suyin.

1171
01:20:34,737 --> 01:20:37,611
- Nothin' to tell.
- Well, maybe there could be.

1172
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:39,125
You and Mac are unbelievable.

1173
01:20:39,177 --> 01:20:41,991
How 'bout you just...
try somethin' new.

1174
01:20:42,192 --> 01:20:45,061
So the rest of your life
isn't a vast wasteland of

1175
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:46,926
misery and solitude.

1176
01:20:47,054 --> 01:20:49,115
I think that's a good idea.

1177
01:20:49,635 --> 01:20:50,880
You do, huh?

1178
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:52,848
Eight-year-olds hear everything.

1179
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:55,208
Jonas...

1180
01:20:58,668 --> 01:21:00,788
My mom likes you, too.

1181
01:21:05,397 --> 01:21:08,303
This is possibly
the worst moment of my life.

1182
01:21:11,641 --> 01:21:13,077
<i>Approaching target area.</i>

1183
01:21:13,174 --> 01:21:14,554
<i>Will confirm visual.</i>

1184
01:21:17,024 --> 01:21:19,435
Let me make myself
absolutely clear.

1185
01:21:19,497 --> 01:21:21,716
We are not getting within
a mile of that monster

1186
01:21:21,764 --> 01:21:23,529
until the helicopter kills it!

1187
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,618
<i>We have a visual on the target.</i>

1188
01:21:25,686 --> 01:21:26,705
Stop the boat.

1189
01:21:27,271 --> 01:21:28,464
Stop the boat!

1190
01:21:31,696 --> 01:21:33,202
<i>Deploying depth charges.</i>

1191
01:21:47,601 --> 01:21:48,920
We got him.

1192
01:21:50,256 --> 01:21:51,373
Hit it again.

1193
01:21:51,544 --> 01:21:53,809
<i>- Sir, there's no way poss...</i>
- Hit it again!

1194
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:03,699
<i>Target is dead.
Repeat. Target is dead.</i>

1195
01:22:03,792 --> 01:22:05,159
Are you absolutely sure?

1196
01:22:05,209 --> 01:22:08,421
Because I'm not getting eaten by
some goddamn prehistoric fish!

1197
01:22:08,467 --> 01:22:10,616
<i>Affirmative, sir.
There's uh...</i>

1198
01:22:10,684 --> 01:22:12,985
Well, there's pieces of it
all over the place.

1199
01:22:13,484 --> 01:22:15,190
<i>Shark chunks.</i>

1200
01:22:15,547 --> 01:22:16,898
That's a good sign.

1201
01:22:17,087 --> 01:22:18,228
All right.

1202
01:22:19,123 --> 01:22:20,286
Take us in.

1203
01:22:27,404 --> 01:22:28,613
Oh!

1204
01:22:29,031 --> 01:22:30,939
Jump down there,
give me a couple o' teeth.

1205
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,422
Big ones for my desk!

1206
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:34,441
- All right.
- Keep one for yourself.

1207
01:22:35,786 --> 01:22:37,056
Nice!

1208
01:22:39,572 --> 01:22:41,116
Whoa, are you seeing this?

1209
01:22:42,751 --> 01:22:44,002
Crazy!

1210
01:22:49,122 --> 01:22:50,737
That's sick!

1211
01:22:56,189 --> 01:22:57,499
That's weird.

1212
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:04,240
Ow, man!

1213
01:23:04,383 --> 01:23:05,696
Don't do that to me.

1214
01:23:05,878 --> 01:23:07,238
That thing doesn't have any teeth.

1215
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,692
What?

1216
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,554
I think we killed a whale.

1217
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,554
It's right below us.

1218
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:17,764
Get us outta here!

1219
01:23:23,109 --> 01:23:25,327
Wait! Wait, you idiots, wait!

1220
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:27,294
I'm over here! Wait!

1221
01:23:29,699 --> 01:23:30,712
Oh, no!

1222
01:23:33,659 --> 01:23:34,679
No!

1223
01:23:35,374 --> 01:23:36,424
Oh!

1224
01:23:38,959 --> 01:23:40,115
Hey!

1225
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:08,204
Yeah, I understand,
I understand, yeah.

1226
01:24:08,274 --> 01:24:09,495
Thank you.

1227
01:24:11,651 --> 01:24:13,949
Let me guess,
Morris never called anyone.

1228
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:15,133
Didn't call anyone.

1229
01:24:15,195 --> 01:24:16,599
No one knows the
shark's out there.

1230
01:24:16,629 --> 01:24:17,654
No one.

1231
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:19,930
Not the Australians,
not the Chinese. No one.

1232
01:24:19,973 --> 01:24:21,173
What the hell was he thinking?

1233
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:23,593
He wanted to make this go
away as quietly as possible.

1234
01:24:23,827 --> 01:24:26,427
- Mac, we need to...
- Let everyone know, yeah, I'm on it.

1235
01:24:26,495 --> 01:24:27,781
Jaxx, can you find that thing?

1236
01:24:27,806 --> 01:24:29,317
Wait, wait, wait.
Why you askin' her that?

1237
01:24:29,341 --> 01:24:31,634
I don't like the fact you're
askin' her about that thing.

1238
01:24:32,756 --> 01:24:34,721
You want me to illegally
hack into Morris'

1239
01:24:34,752 --> 01:24:37,507
satellite tracking system
to find a prehistoric shark?

1240
01:24:37,634 --> 01:24:38,640
Yeah.

1241
01:24:38,825 --> 01:24:39,867
Okay.

1242
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:42,417
We use the tracker, find
the meg, then we kill it.

1243
01:24:42,442 --> 01:24:43,473
Bro...

1244
01:24:45,646 --> 01:24:47,123
We really gonna do this?

1245
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:49,017
A lot of people are gonna die
if we don't, Mac.

1246
01:24:49,053 --> 01:24:50,530
- I'm in.
- Me too.

1247
01:24:50,572 --> 01:24:51,622
Let's do this.

1248
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:54,707
How do you feel about
commandeering the evac ship?

1249
01:24:54,738 --> 01:24:56,763
Oh, I'd say uh,

1250
01:24:56,910 --> 01:24:58,571
it's a great day to go fishing.

1251
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:01,160
Then let's get
everything on it.

1252
01:25:01,259 --> 01:25:04,055
Construction, explosives,
gliders, the whole lot.

1253
01:25:04,081 --> 01:25:06,291
- Everything.
- Because we're about to evac, right?

1254
01:25:06,369 --> 01:25:07,677
Like evacuate?

1255
01:25:07,756 --> 01:25:09,974
Like leave the area
of imminent danger

1256
01:25:10,036 --> 01:25:11,448
and go to a safe place

1257
01:25:11,487 --> 01:25:13,074
like normal people?

1258
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:25,877
What do you got, Jaxx?
Anything?

1259
01:25:25,945 --> 01:25:28,393
Yeah, here's where we saw
Morris tag the shark.

1260
01:25:28,609 --> 01:25:31,106
But here,
is where it's going.

1261
01:25:31,276 --> 01:25:33,525
- Sanya Bay, what's there?
- Oh, nothin'.

1262
01:25:33,672 --> 01:25:35,033
It only has some of the most

1263
01:25:35,064 --> 01:25:37,280
densely-populated
beaches in the world.

1264
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:38,837
Any luck with the authorities?

1265
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:39,949
No.

1266
01:25:39,974 --> 01:25:42,512
'Prehistoric shark' sounds
like a damn prank call.

1267
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,330
We can't rely on
them for anything.

1268
01:25:44,682 --> 01:25:46,874
How long until the shark
gets to those people?

1269
01:25:46,899 --> 01:25:48,590
- 20 minutes
- Can we get there first?

1270
01:25:48,615 --> 01:25:49,620
Doubtful.

1271
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:51,209
- Yeah, we're gonna have to.
- Yeah, well, getting there first

1272
01:25:51,233 --> 01:25:53,361
won't mean anything
if we don't have a plan.

1273
01:25:53,566 --> 01:25:55,306
Maybe we have a plan.

1274
01:25:58,481 --> 01:26:00,825
Here's where we do it,
right here in shallows.

1275
01:26:01,257 --> 01:26:02,771
Use the gliders
and go out there.

1276
01:26:02,821 --> 01:26:04,591
Okay, so, how are we
gonna get it here?

1277
01:26:04,695 --> 01:26:07,406
When there's a beach full of
people to eat right here?

1278
01:26:08,325 --> 01:26:09,858
You ask it out for dinner.

1279
01:26:22,048 --> 01:26:24,704
So, how do you wanna do this?

1280
01:26:25,991 --> 01:26:27,579
So, are you asking my opinion?

1281
01:26:27,843 --> 01:26:29,029
No.

1282
01:26:29,115 --> 01:26:30,922
I was just being polite

1283
01:26:30,947 --> 01:26:33,045
before telling you what
we're actually doing.

1284
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:35,557
So you'll feel better
about yourself.

1285
01:26:35,654 --> 01:26:36,821
Appreciate that.

1286
01:26:44,581 --> 01:26:46,571
- What?
- Nothin'.

1287
01:26:47,308 --> 01:26:48,478
We're ready.

1288
01:27:42,016 --> 01:27:43,102
Pippin!

1289
01:27:43,841 --> 01:27:44,844
Pippin!

1290
01:27:44,997 --> 01:27:46,108
Pippin!

1291
01:27:50,151 --> 01:27:51,201
Hey, Pippin!

1292
01:27:51,734 --> 01:27:52,754
Pippin!

1293
01:28:11,904 --> 01:28:12,930
Pippin!

We're close enough.
Stop here.

1300
01:29:54,368 --> 01:29:56,745
Jaxx, DJ, we gotta get
that thing in the water.

1301
01:29:56,788 --> 01:29:57,970
Yeah, we're on it.

1302
01:30:54,659 --> 01:30:55,870
Shark!

1303
01:31:12,107 --> 01:31:13,340
Mama!

1304
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:20,796
Mama!

1305
01:32:22,247 --> 01:32:23,419
Mama!

1306
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:05,410
<i>Any last thoughts
about our plan?</i>

1307
01:33:05,644 --> 01:33:07,708
Not dying
would be a good start.

1308
01:33:08,529 --> 01:33:10,332
Finally, we agree on something.

1309
01:33:10,387 --> 01:33:11,852
<i>Let's not make it a habit.</i>

1310
01:33:12,524 --> 01:33:14,325
Suyin, look out!
Get outta there!

1311
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:26,888
- Damn it!
- What's wrong, Jonas?

1312
01:33:26,921 --> 01:33:28,864
Can't make the shot.
It's too close to the ship!

1313
01:33:30,523 --> 01:33:31,634
Jesus.

1314
01:33:33,819 --> 01:33:35,333
<i>Jonas, it's on you!</i>

1315
01:33:35,517 --> 01:33:36,610
Mac!

1316
01:33:39,966 --> 01:33:41,617
Jonas, what's goin' on
down there?

1317
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:43,375
Tryin' to stay out of its mouth!

1318
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,439
Jesus!

1319
01:34:14,041 --> 01:34:15,128
Oops.

1320
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:18,857
<i>Suyin, you set?
I'm comin' to you.</i>

1321
01:34:18,918 --> 01:34:20,073
I'm in position.

1322
01:34:20,852 --> 01:34:22,107
<i>Shark's getting close.</i>

1323
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,777
Need a little breathing room.

1324
01:34:30,603 --> 01:34:32,453
- I'm ready to fire!
<i>- Take the shot!</i>

1325
01:34:34,352 --> 01:34:35,593
Move! Move!

1326
01:34:57,534 --> 01:34:58,767
Anybody see it?

1327
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:00,931
<i>Can't see the shark.
But something's going on up here.</i>

1328
01:35:10,603 --> 01:35:12,690
<i>Okay, I got her attention.</i>

1329
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:17,510
Bring her to me.

1330
01:35:18,081 --> 01:35:19,315
Here we come.

1331
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:23,633
Make your move, Suyin.

1332
01:35:27,799 --> 01:35:29,734
Chew on this,
you ugly bastard!

1333
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:34,692
No, no, no, no! Sh...

1334
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:38,133
Jeez!

1335
01:36:02,987 --> 01:36:04,819
Go, go. Go!

1336
01:36:17,469 --> 01:36:19,068
- Where's DJ?
- I don't know!

1337
01:36:19,568 --> 01:36:20,811
- Where is Meiying?
- I don't know!

1338
01:36:20,835 --> 01:36:21,889
I couldn't see her anywhere.

1339
01:36:21,913 --> 01:36:23,501
Jonas, sorry, I...

1340
01:36:23,546 --> 01:36:25,200
Go, go! Take care of Meiying.

1341
01:36:32,587 --> 01:36:33,838
Jonas!

1342
01:36:33,936 --> 01:36:35,951
<i>I'm okay. I'm leading
it away from the ship.</i>

1343
01:36:39,692 --> 01:36:40,791
Oh, my God!

1344
01:36:40,957 --> 01:36:42,642
Stop splashing!

1345
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:45,290
You have a life jacket on!

1346
01:36:45,507 --> 01:36:47,168
- A life jacket?
- Yep.

1347
01:36:47,311 --> 01:36:48,337
Oh, yeah.

1348
01:36:48,566 --> 01:36:49,683
I got a life jacket on.

1349
01:36:49,733 --> 01:36:51,753
- It's right here. I can...
- Shh! Shh!

1350
01:36:52,217 --> 01:36:53,913
The monster's here.

1351
01:36:53,993 --> 01:36:55,104
The monster's here?

1352
01:36:55,154 --> 01:36:56,724
No, don't worry about
the monster, I got you.

1353
01:36:56,748 --> 01:36:58,860
Stop talking!

1354
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:05,193
- Meiying!
- Mommy!

1355
01:37:05,451 --> 01:37:06,715
It's you!

1356
01:37:07,935 --> 01:37:10,702
W-W-Wait for me!
Wait for DJ! Wait for DJ!

1357
01:37:10,875 --> 01:37:12,603
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Come on!

1358
01:37:14,034 --> 01:37:15,854
Mommy, are you okay?

1359
01:37:17,769 --> 01:37:19,021
I'm okay.

1360
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:21,054
I'm okay, too.

1361
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:26,154
Come on, come up.

1362
01:37:27,593 --> 01:37:28,593
All right here.

1363
01:37:28,625 --> 01:37:29,694
Jonas!

1364
01:37:30,210 --> 01:37:31,242
Careful, careful.

1365
01:37:32,111 --> 01:37:33,149
There it is.

1366
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:34,990
- Oh, my God.
- Jonas!

1367
01:37:35,752 --> 01:37:36,816
It's coming.

1368
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:38,392
<i>We're sitting ducks
up here, Jonas!</i>

1369
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,483
<i>Can you hear me, Jonas?</i>

1370
01:37:40,575 --> 01:37:42,138
<i>Meiying, hold on.</i>

1371
01:37:42,199 --> 01:37:43,458
<i>Suyin, we gonna have to...</i>

1372
01:37:43,495 --> 01:37:45,632
Jonas, we've got nothing left.

1373
01:37:45,725 --> 01:37:47,141
Almost nothin'.

1374
01:37:47,604 --> 01:37:49,051
How are you gonna kill it?

1375
01:37:49,121 --> 01:37:50,440
Evolution.

1376
01:37:50,519 --> 01:37:52,182
I'm gonna make this thing bleed.

1377
01:37:52,739 --> 01:37:54,821
<i>Suyin, what you said before,
you were right.</i>

1378
01:37:55,071 --> 01:37:56,939
It's not about the people you lose.

1379
01:37:58,795 --> 01:38:00,611
<i>It's about the people you save.</i>

1380
01:38:02,739 --> 01:38:04,803
- Signin' off.
<i>- Jonas, don't!</i>

1381
01:38:11,434 --> 01:38:12,716
Here we go.

1382
01:38:19,491 --> 01:38:21,933
How d'you like that?
Bleed!

1383
01:38:30,521 --> 01:38:31,785
Come on, come on, come on!

1384
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:41,002
Hey. Hey!

1385
01:40:45,431 --> 01:40:46,560
Yes!

1386
01:41:14,917 --> 01:41:16,050
Thank you.

1387
01:41:19,755 --> 01:41:21,512
Beep beep!
Coming through, crazy!

1388
01:41:21,549 --> 01:41:23,106
- Hi.
- Look who it is.

1389
01:41:26,777 --> 01:41:29,366
Oh! Here's to being alive!

1390
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:35,111
And to our friends...

1391
01:41:41,541 --> 01:41:43,044
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1392
01:41:46,978 --> 01:41:49,386
I don't know about you, but uh...

1393
01:41:49,642 --> 01:41:51,549
I could use a vacation.

1394
01:41:51,691 --> 01:41:53,363
Shall we ask my mom?
